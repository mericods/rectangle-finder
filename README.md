# rectangle-finder
This is a function code for finding and counting rectangles in a given grid.(List of strings, which are rows. Assume that input has same length of strings.)

* Rows contain '0's and '1's. Each '1' represents a dot, then they make edges of the rectangles.

* Each rectangle should have at least one '0' inside of it, in order to be counted.

Example input: P = ["111100", "110111", "011111", "111111"]

Output: 2

  If you have any optimization, please let me know. This is the first real code I have done.
